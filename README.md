# Asteroids
Using Python Arcade to practice OOP principles.

On this project, I had to use OOP basic principles such as inheritance and polymorphism to create the classic arcade game, Asteroids.

What was the most challenging?
Set up the spaceship gravity, having inertia while flying, giving the user the sensation that the ship is floating in space.

What did I like the most?
To implement the interplay of the different objects that float in space. Also, use inheritance to create different kinds of Asteroids.

What would I improve?
I would create lives for the spaceship and hit levels. In this way, it would take more than a single hit to destroy the ship, but it will lose a "life percentage" according to the size of the asteroid it hit.
